            In February 2024, Radu faced a harrowing ordeal when he was stolen. It was a distressing time for Kal and everyone who loves Radu. However, thanks to the incredible efforts of Peel Regional Police, Radu was safely returned home in July 2024. The reunion was nothing short of miraculous, and Radu’s story touched the hearts of many.
